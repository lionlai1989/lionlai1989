### 📖 Exploring Beyond the Ordinary

**If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.** — Haruki Murakami (村上春樹)

I’ve always been fascinated by exploring the principles that underlie things, and I find it incredibly fulfilling to appreciate how simple components can converge to form complex systems. The last three roles I held have consistently demonstrated my innate inclination to construct challenging systems by using fundamental elements:

**Computer Vision Software Engineer**: Developing libraries and pipelines for 3D computer vision to generate 3D models using stereo satellite imagery  
**Space Engineering Master's Graduate**: Integrating dual quaternion into the Unscented Kalman Filter to accurately estimate the pose of satellites.  
**Embedded Software Engineer**: Enabling real-time speech recognition across diverse platforms by adapting speech recognition algorithms to different development boards.  


### 👨‍💻 My Interests
My fascination lies at the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and programming.

### ⚡ Fun fact

After taking multiple 16-personality tests at different stages of my life, the result has consistently categorized me as an Assertive Architect (INTJ-A). Admittedly, while I acknowledge that this personality type may not always be regarded as a compliment in romantic relationships of mine, I believe that this unfortunate blessing has guided me throughout my learning journey, during which I have always found joy in dedicating my spare time to exploring diverse topics, including machine learning and computer vision.
